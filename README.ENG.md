## 🚀 Abstract
Hundreds of years from now, humankind will have developed advanced technology capable of transporting them and sustaining them on other planets. Countries worldwide have come together to create a single agency that oversees all exploration; the agency is named Space Metaverse Token (SPMT).
SPMT is a one-of-a-kind metaverse gaming platform where you can explore simulated planets and experience immersive reality. You may find tremendous opportunities for financial gain in the game, all while exploring and having fun in the metaverse.
SPMT is an exploration of the universe and the next big Play2Earn (P2E) game. SPMT is set to launch on the Binance Smart Chain network and offers investors various opportunities to earn money by acquiring private individual planets, developing them, and creating a micro-economy. The first collection of 15,000 SPMT Planet NFTs will be launched, each with unique characteristics and stats. The SPMT cryptocurrency and BEP-20 token, $SPMT, will be used to decentralize the digital galaxy.
This white paper provides a high-level overview of the SPMT project. The main focus is on the intriguing blockchain technology used to establish a virtual game metaverse. This is not a technical white paper; instead, it is a general audience, gamers, and metaverse enthusiasts' introduction to SPMT Project.


## 🚀 Introduction
"The metaverse" has been turned into a buzzword by executives, analysts, and investors seeking to capitalize on this emerging technology. The metaverse is a futuristic virtual world where humans can work, play, rest, socialize, etc. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are anticipated to seamlessly combine the virtual and real worlds in the growing digital environment. The metaverse will alter our perception of the internet.
Ubiquitous 5G high-speed internet access, Web 3.0, virtual reality, augmented reality, blockchain technology, NFTs, and growing markets like remote work and online socializing are all helping to pave the way for the metaverse.
According to Gartner, Inc., the number of individuals spending at least one hour every day in the metaverse for work, retail, education, social, or entertainment will increase by 25% in 2026. And according to Morgan Stanley, overall VR AR expenditures worldwide are expected to expand at a CAGR of 57 percent, from $12 billion in 2020 to $72.8 billion in 2024. Another report claims that the metaverse or virtual worlds, might be worth $8 trillion in revenue. In conclusion, experts estimate that the metaverse will be worth $1 trillion additional value per year. This is why investors, entrepreneurs, and technology corporations are vying for a piece of the rising tech market that creates significant opportunities.
Metaverse is working on further combining the high-speed web with tangible sensory inputs to create more highly immersive digital environments. The immersive three-dimensional screen layer and integrated tactile inputs across a whole range of sense organs are used to create these virtual experiences. This virtual universe will generate a slew of new apps and enterprises and new career opportunities.
The SPMT team believes that the metaverse is already here. We are creating the SPMT Metaverse to ensure you are positioned for entertainment and financial success with many opportunities to earn in our metaverse.


## 🚀 The Blockchain Technology

The blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as "completed" blocks are added with new records. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Crypto nodes use the blockchain to differentiate legitimate crypto transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. The blockchain confirms transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. It also acts as a permanent record of these transactions. The integrity and chronological order of the blockchain are enforced with cryptography. The blockchain is a distributed database. Each node (computer) on the network possesses a complete and up-to-date copy of the blockchain. Thus, it's the safest way to verify transactions between two parties and establish their legitimacy.


## 🚀 Web3.0

The decentralized web, also known as Web 3.0, is a new version of the internet based on blockchain technology. It envisions a decentralized, community-driven internet where people control their data and where fascinating creative content is accessible and available to everyone. It is becoming clear that the Metaverse is Web 3.0's natural user interface. It provides individuals with a fun, gamified, and practical method to interact with a decentralized, blockchain-based internet.


## 🚀 Open Metaverse
Interoperability is the closest word to describe an open metaverse. Still, the open metaverse is more than just interconnected metaverses. The metaverse is a virtual world where users can manage their transactions, assets, and data. Instead of creating an open, decentralized Metaverse, big tech focuses on expanding their own strictly controlled assets, locking everyone into their product, and charging whatever they want. But with the open metaverse — which is characterized by open-source software and open standards, the community of users has the power; this is a retort to the mega-corporations that control the majority of the world's digital-value-creating assets and data.
The open metaverse is made possible with a blockchain bridge. A blockchain bridge, also referred to as a token bridge, is a link that allows tokens and arbitrary data to be transferred from one blockchain to another. The bridges rely on a single chain to prove token ownership (or numerous tokens). They then send this data to other connected blockchains, utilizing it on another chain. This implies that two or more blockchains with distinct underlying protocols can communicate and collaborate safely and swiftly. 
The SPMT project is built for the open metaverse; players will be able to securely transfer digital assets in and out of the SPMT metaverse in the later stage of the project. Adopting the open metaverse concept for the SPMT project aligns with the next version of the internet (Web3.0), reinforcing true decentralization.

## 🚀 Mission and Vision Statement 

Our mission is to work with our community to create a system incorporating economics, games, and NFTs. The vision is to integrate NFT, gaming, and metaverse to reach an enjoyable, profitable, and global level of technology. We foresee a digital universe that grows with time and usage and an economy that drives the game and raises the value of $SPMT due to more user engagement.


## 🚀 The SPMT Project
The SPMT is the first blockchain project to implement meta-tourism fully controlled by players, where creativity is only limited to the players' intuition - A galaxy of endless possibilities and opportunities. 
The SPMT project is for everyone; investors, gamers, explorers, crypto enthusiasts, and even casual internet users. At the initial stage of the project, the SPMT team has identified and named 15,000 habitable planets ready for sale. Once purchased, everything needed to develop these planets are also available as NFTs, which can be

•	Minted and uploaded into the SPMT Metaverse

•	Purchased from an in-built marketplace in the SPMT Metaverse

•	Purchased from peer SPMT Metaverse players (P2P)

•	Or import from another Metaverse (interoperability)

The SPMT project employed a gamified approach to keep the fun alive. On entering the SPMT Metaverse, players can decide to float to their planet or take a space shuttle – which is faster. Individual players in the SPMT Metaverse can own these space shuttles for personal use or commercial transportation – which is one of the numerous ways of earning in the SPMT Metaverse. Also, there are free planets to explore for players who can’t afford to pay the tourism fee.



## 🚀 $SPMT Utility Token
$SPMT token is the utility token used for transactions and other processes in the SPMT project and metaverse. SPMT cryptocurrency is an BEP-20 token on the BSC network.
BEP-20 tokens are digital assets that use the Ethereum blockchain to represent a particular ownership stake or entitlement in a blockchain project. These tokens are created and distributed using a smart contract, which allows for a more streamlined and automated process than traditional fundraising methods. BEP-20 tokens can represent various things, including voting rights, shares in a company, or access to a particular service – in this case, the SPMT Metaverse.

## 🚀 Tokenomics and Distribution
The total supply of $SPMT tokens will be pegged at 10,000,000,000. Each token is valued at $0.00025. Tokens will be sold through an ICO and soon be available on Launchpad. The tokens will be distributed in the following proportion among the major stakeholders:


| Stakeholder | Percentage    | Amount               | Value                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `The Team` | `10%` | 1,000,000,000 |$250,000| 
| `Staking and rewards` | `24%` | 2,400,000,000 |$600,000 | 
| `ICO` | `30%` | 3,000,000,000 |$750,000 | 
| `Mining` | `36%` | 3,600,000,000|$900,000  | 
| `Total` | `100%` | 10,000,000,000 |$2,500,000 | 



## 🚀 SPMT Metaverse Experiences

The SPMT Metaverse is full of immersive experiences to keep players engaged. These experiences allow players to interact and engage in three-dimensional space - allowing users to explore new environments, socialize with others, and participate in activities.


## - Tourism
Meta-tourism is a relatively new term used to describe the phenomenon of people traveling to virtual worlds, or "metaverses," for tourism. These metaverses can be accessed through various digital platforms, such as video games, social networks, or specialized websites. In recent years, there has been an increase in people who visit metaverses for recreational purposes.
In the SPMT Metaverse, planet owners can create fictional landscapes or scenes based on real-life locations. Metaverse tourists typically visit these virtual landscapes to experience something phenomenal.



## - Mining
There are $SPMT tokens hidden under the surface of each of the planets in the SPMT Metaverse; planet owners can dig their planets, mine these tokens, and have them as a reward for their effort. The mined $SPMT tokens immediately reflect on the player's digital balance inside the wallet. The tokens can then be converted into cash or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges. 35% of the total $SPMT token supply is dedicated to this course.
The SPMT metaverse provides essential mining tools such as picks, shovels, and axes but manually mining tokens on SPMT planets can be a daunting task and consumes a lot of time; this is why there are premium mining tools that planet owners can acquire to mine resources faster on their planets. Such tools include scanners, excavators, drills, dozers, etc. These tools are in the form of an NFT, and their value varies based on their efficiency; they can be resold if the owner no longer finds a use for them.


## - Development
Planet owners must develop their planets to make them attractive and worthy of visitor exploration. Developing the planets depends on individual owners of the planets; they can build various real estate assets for personal or business purposes. They can create assets for rent or buy assets to resell when their value rises.
There are tools to speed up the development process, and ready-made real estate assets are available in the SPMT in-house marketplace inside the metaverse. There will also be a provision for planet owners to create their complete real-estate assets from ordinary digital files, mint them into NFTs and upload it into the SPMT Metaverse. But this will be in the later stage of the project. Meanwhile, they can acquire tools to build or purchase the assets as a whole from the marketplace or other players in the metaverse.
Furthermore, developing SPMT planets open opportunities for civil engineering and other professionals in the construction industry. Planet owners can hire professionals to build unique and fascinating structures on their planets.


## - Trading
In the SPMT Metaverse, trading is a process of transferring virtual items from one user to another. This can be done for various reasons, including exchanging virtual items for virtual tokens, trading one type of virtual item for another, or simply giving the item away as a gift. The process of trading in the SPMT Metaverse is similar to that of trading in the real world. Each party agrees to the terms of the trade and then completes the exchange.
All transactions in the SPMT Metaverses will be executed with $SPMT tokens – the project's utility token. Successful transactions immediately reflet in the transactors' wallets. The history of past transactions can also be found in the wallet.


## - User-Generated Experiences
User-generated SPMT Metaverse experiences are limitless because different players have different ideas of what they will turn their planets to.


## 🚀 SPMT Features

## - NFTs
NFT is a key concept in the metaverse ecosystem, allowing users to own virtual products like planets, real-estate properties, digital items such as space shuttles, mining and construction tools, and even accessories.
NFTs are built on blockchain technology and offer full ownership rights. For instance, if you own a planet in the SPMT Metaverse, you will receive an NFT as a deed to the virtual property. This indicates you are the legitimate owner and have exclusive access to the planet in the SPMT Metaverse and the ability to grant others access.

## - Community
The most significant aspect of the SPMT project is the community. In the SPMT project, the community is essential since it facilitates supporters and connections around the world. The SPMT Community also serves several objectives, including associating based on shared interests and networking in the SPMT metaverse and contributing financial support for the project's implementation through token and NFT purchases. The SPMT project aims to reach at least 100 million community members worldwide.


## - Virtual Economy
A virtual economy operates in a fantasy environment, generally one that is virtual. These economies are primarily seen in multi-user, real-time online virtual worlds. Virtual currencies exist in virtual economies. While these virtual currencies cannot usually be exchanged for real-world currency in a bank or a change bureau, they can be traded on decentralized exchanges or among users' peers.
The virtual economy in the SPMT is similar to a real one, albeit there are notable distinctions; for example, no need to pay taxes or feeding expenses in the metaverse. However, because players engage and participate in the SPMT Metaverse activities, some factors, such as the need to pay for services, acquire digital assets, explore particular planets, etc., necessitate a payment. And the payments are processed with the $SPMT cryptocurrency.

## - Staking
Staking on the SPMT blockchain is the process of committing your $SPMT cryptocurrency assets to support and confirm transactions on the SPMT network. Staking is how SPMT verifies transactions and lets $SPMT holders earn rewards on their assets. Because the SPMT token employs proof-of-stake to validate transactions, it permits staking. The proof-of-stake model uses less energy than the traditional proof-of-work model.
Staking is an excellent strategy to earn passive income with your $SPMT tokens, mainly because $SPMT pays out high-interest rates for staking. SPMT's annual staking interest rate is as high as 7%.

## - DAO
SPMT DAO is a way of organizing how the project is run. DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and it is responsible for key decision-making. This means that there is no single person in charge; instead, decisions concerning the SPMT project are made by all participants of the SPMT DAO. The decision is made by allowing every participant in the DAO to vote for or against the decision.
The criteria for participating in the SPMT DAO is acquiring one of the 15,000 SPMT Planet NFTs. The right to participate in the SPMT DAO is only reserved for the current holder of the Planet NFT. However, the DAO right is transferable if the current holder transfers it to another person.

## - Wallet
A crypto wallet is a digital storage medium for cryptocurrencies. The Wallet stores the public and private keys needed to access and spend the $SPMT tokens. The tokens are stored in the wallet's address, a unique string of alphanumeric characters. Currently, we'll be utilizing generic wallets that support BEP-20 tokens, such as Atomic Wallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, etc. Later, we will develop our custom SPMT Wallet. The SPMT Wallet is a multi-currency wallet which means it supports other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

## 🚀  How to earn in the SPMT Metaverse
## -🪐 Tourism
Metaverse tourism is a new type of travel exploring potential interactions between different universes or multiverses. This form of tourism has been growing in popularity in recent years, as people have become more fascinated by alternate universes and the opportunities they may provide for tourists. Metaverse tourism allows individuals to explore different universes or multiverses through virtual reality headsets, computer programs, or games. Planet owners in the SPMT Metaverse can develop their planets to be fascinating for tourism and then charge tourists for access.

## -🪐 Leasing
Similar to the real world, planet owners can lease out their planets once developed for a specific purpose. For instance, if a planet is designed for educational purposes – all resources to enhance learning have been created inside the planet. The owner can then lease out the planet to educational institutions for a specific period, thereby earning from the lease.

## -🪐 Planet development
Planet owners in the metaverse can develop their planet up to standard and auction it for sale to other SPMT players. The planet will be sold at a price higher than the development cost, thereby making a profit and earning from the development.

## -🪐 Trading
All metaverse users can trade digital assets and tokens inside the metaverse. The SPMT economy is dynamic; values of assets fluctuate. Users can use the dynamic value to purchase assets during a dip and sell them off during a rise, thereby earning profits.


## -🪐  Services
Not all planet owners will have the time and resources to develop their planets on their own; they will need help from someone who can complete some tasks on their behalf. Some users can then profit by offering various services to planet owners. For instance, civil engineers can earn by providing construction services during planet development.


## -🪐 Mining
There are random amounts of $SPMT tokens hidden below the surface of each SPMT planet; planet owners can only have these tokens when they mine them. Once mined, the tokens reflect on the balance inside the connected crypto wallet.


## -🪐  Staking
Crypto staking is a form of investment that allows users to earn rewards while retaining ownership of their cryptocurrencies. SPMT Staking is how holders use their SPMT tokens to validate transactions and get rewards. This process allows stakers to earn instant rewards, a significant advantage for users who hold their digital assets in their wallets.


## 🚀 SPMT Core Technologies

## - Smart Contract
A smart contract is a blockchain protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the execution of credible transactions without third parties. The network nodes verified these transactions and recorded them in a dispersed public ledger called a blockchain. Smart contracts handle all operations and processes in the SPMT Metaverse, eliminating human interference. Thus, it seamlessly and securely executes instructions in split seconds.

## - Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is used in the metaverse to create and control interactive computer-based characters known as avatars. These avatars can interact with other objects in the virtual world. They can be customized to look and act however the user desires. The use of artificial intelligence allows for more realistic and lifelike interactions in the metaverse, which can help to improve the overall user experience.
Artificial intelligence will play a significant role in the SPMT Metaverse. It will be used to create intelligent avatars and manage the many aspects of the virtual world. AI will also be used to create realistic environments and objects, making the SPMT Metaverse feel more like a real-world environment.


## - VR/AR
Virtual reality is an artificial, computer-generated environment that can be experienced through special electronic equipment, such as headsets or gloves. It can create the illusion of being in another place or time. The SPMT Metaverse is a virtual world built on the blockchain.
 It allows players to interact and explore via VR and AR interfaces. Planets in the SPMT Metaverse are parallel to the real world. It typically contains many of the same features as the real world, such as buildings, streets, and landscapes. And VR/AR will help to explore it seamlessly.

## - Gamification
Metaverse gamification uses gaming mechanics in non-gaming contexts to engage and motivate users. Gamification generally relies on feedback mechanisms, leaderboards, badges, and other rewards to engage users and encourage participation.
Gamification in the SPMT Metaverse refers to gaming mechanics and design principles to engage and motivate players to achieve their goals. Gamification can add an extra dimension of fun and excitement to interactions while providing a more immersive experience. It can also help promote social connectedness and collaboration in the SPMT Metaverse and increase players’ motivation to learn and explore.
